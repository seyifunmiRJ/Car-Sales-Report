# Project Name: Car Sales Analysis Report
This is a US car dealership that sells various car models. To effectively track and analyze sales performance, a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard in Power BI is needed. The dashboard will visualize critical KPIs related to car sales, in order to understand sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.

# Project objective: Problem Statement
Their current dashboard lacks the ability to provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) pertinent to sales data. The absence of such functionality hinders the ability to make informed decisions, monitor progress effectively, and identify trends and opportunities for growth. Specifically, a comprehensive data on Sales Overview, including Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales, Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales, Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales, and the Difference between YTD Sales and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales is required. Also, a detailed analysis on Average Price and Cars Sold Metrics, encompassing YTD and MTD figures, YOY Growth, and comparisons with PTYD. Addressing this issue is crucial for optimizing decision-making processes and driving business growth.

# Data Sourcing:
This data was sourced from Kaggle.

# Data Cleaning:
To ensure accuracy and the reliability of the analysis, the data was cleaned and manipulated using power query editor in Power BI. The Dashboard was created using Power BI desktop.
